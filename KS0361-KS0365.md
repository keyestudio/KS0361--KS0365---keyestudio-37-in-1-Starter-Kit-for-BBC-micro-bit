## 1.Introduction

**(1) What is Micro:bit?**

Designed by BBC, micro:bit main board aims to help children aged above 10 years
old to have a better learning of programming.

It is equipped with loads of components, including a 5*5 LED dot matrix, 2
programmable buttons, a compass, and a BT module.

This new version, that’s the micro:bit 2.0 board, has a touch-sensitive logo and
a MEMS microphone. And there is a built-in buzzer which can play sounds. The
golden fingers and gears added provide a better fixing of crocodile clips.
Moreover, this board has a sleeping mode to lower the power consumption of
battery and it can be entered if users long press the Reset & Power button on
the back of it. More importantly, the CPU capacity of this version is much
better than that of the V1.5 and the V2 has more RMA.

In final analysis, the V2 Micro:bit main board can allow customers to explore
more functions so as to make more innovative products.

Serving as a better device for learning some basic knowledge about
microcontroller and electronics, this sensor kit is designed by Keyestudio to
help programming enthusiasts enter this wonderful world. In application, we can
plug a shield in with DC7-9V to power not only the Micro bit board but also the
sensors/ modules. And the shield can be connected by jumper cap to control the
voltage of ports V1 and V2 used to supply power for sensors. We plan to provide
instructions for using this board and sensors/ modules, including offering
connection diagrams and test code.

For Micro: Bit main board V2, pressing the Reset & Power button , it will reset
the Micro: Bit and rerun the program. If you hold it tight, the red LED will
slowly get darker.When the power indicator flickers into darkness, releasing the
button and your Micro: Bit board will enter sleep mode for power saving .This
will make the battery more durable. And you could press this button again to
“wake up” your Micro:bit.

**(4) Notes for the application of Micro:bit main board V2.0**

1.  It is recommended to cover it with a silicone protector to prevent short
    circuit for it has a lot of sophisticated electronic components.

2.  Its IO port is very weak in driving since it can merely handle current less
    than 300mA. Therefore, do not connect it with devices operating in large
    current,such as servo MG995 and DC motor or it will get burnt. Furthermore,
    you must figure out the current requirements of the devices before you use
    them and it is generally recommended to use the board together with a
    Micro:bit shield.

3.  It is recommended to power the main board via the USB interface or via the
    battery of 3V. The IO port of this board is 3V, so it does not support
    sensors of 5V. If you need to connect sensors of 5 V, a Micro: bit expansion
    board is required.

d.When using pins(P3、P4、P6、P7、P10)shared with the LED dot matrix, blocking
them from the matrix or the LEDs may display randomly and data about sensors
maybe wrong.

e.The battery port of 3V cannot be connected with battery more than 3.3V or the
main board will be damaged.

f. Forbid to use it on metal products to avoid short circuit.

To put it simple, Micro:bit V2 main board is like a microcomputer which has made
programming at our fingertips and enhanced digital innovation. And about
programming environment, BBC provides a website: <https://microbit.org/code/,>
which has a graphical MakeCode program easy for use.

## 3.Install Micro:bit driver

If you have downloaded micro:bit driver, then no need to download it again.

If it is you first time to use micro:bit main board, then you will have to
download the driver.

First of all, connect the micro:bit to your computer using a USB cable.

And enter website
<https://www.dropbox.com/sh/w5mv8mvvufti0uj/AADTFPTV8NBN0IxQj_3TZ8ETa?dl=0> to
download the driver file of micro:bit
![](media/7ddfc336324207296865090fe6456f43.png).

## 4.Instructions

The following instructions are applied for Windows system but can also serve as
a reference if you are using a different system.

**4.1 Write code and program**

This chapter describes how to write program with the Micro: bit main board V2
and load the program to the board.

You are recommended to browse the official website of Micro:bit for more
details, and the link is attached below:

[https://microbit.org/guide/quick/](Https://microbit.org/guide/quick/)

**Step 1:** connect the Micro: bit main board V2 with your computer

Firstly, link the Micro: bit main board V2 with your computer via the USB cable.
Macs, PCs, Chromebooks and Linux（including Raspberry Pi）systems are all
compatible with this board.

Note that if you are about to pair the board with your phone or tablet, please
refer to this link:

<https://microbit.org/get-started/user-guide/mobile/>

![](media/f00f946e1f194811b1c84725e0eb5d16.png)
![](media/18c70cf16dcf8c9694a1af8b12530cf9.png)

Secondly, the red LED on the back of the board is on, which means the board is
powered. Then Micro: bit main board V2 will appear on your computer as a driver
named “MICROBIT(E:)”. Please note that it is not an ordinary USB disk as shown
below.

![](media/a2b53f93f4c24b81fc5cdb5986fd100d.png)

**Step 2:** write programs

View the link https://makecode.microbit.org/ in your browser;

Click ‘New Project’;

The dialog box‘Create a Project’ appears, fill it with ‘heartbeat’ and
click‘Create √’to edit.

(If you are running Windows 10 system, it is also viable to edit on the APP
MakeCode for micro:bit , which is exactly like editing in the website. And the
link to the APP is
https://www.microsoft.com/zh-cn/p/makecode-for-micro-bit/9pjc7sv48lcx?ocid=badgep&rtc=1&activetab=pivot:overviewtab

![](media/397bd09e4c2baf3c933857f3d0d1b83f.png)

![](media/5427d2c4fbb30ffdbce2fe9315244245.png)

Write a set of micro:bit code. You can drag some modules in the Blocks to the
editing area and then run your program in Simulator of MakeCode editor as shown
in the picture below, which demonstrates how to edit ‘heartbeat’ program .

As for loading test code , please turn to Chapter 4.5. And introduction of
MakeCode is on the next chapter 4.2.

![](media/a6aa8681158ce5b64ffba50c1238f8c8.png)

**Step 3**: download test code

If your computer is Windows 10 and you have downloaded the APP MakeCode for
micro:bit to write program, what you will have to do to download the program to
your Micro: bit main board V2 is merely clicking the ‘Download’ button, then all
is done.

If you are writing program through the website, following these steps:

Click the ‘Download’ in the editor to download a "hex" file, which is a compact
program format that the Micro: bit main board can read. Once the hexadecimal
file is downloaded, copy it to your board V2 just like the process that you copy
the file to the USB driver. If you are running Windows system, you can also
right-click and select ‘Send to → MICROBIT (E:) ‘to copy the hex file to the
Micro: bit main board V2

![](media/a81d4430eb152346d13bf67b2233b9db.png)

You can also directly drag the "hex" file onto the MICROBIT (E:) disk.

![](media/fe0f2de72ba0b38f00403f1aaef7f514.png)

![](media/b4f3602c0e192646f77b150e2acaf947.png)

During the process of copying the downloaded hex file to the Micro: bit main
board V2, the yellow signal light on the back side of the board flashes. When
the copy is completed, the yellow signal light will stop flashing and remain on.

**Step 4**: run the program

After the program is uploaded to the Micro: bit main board V2, you could still
power it via the USB cable or change to via an external power. The 5 x 5 LED dot
matrix on the board displays the heartbeat pattern.

| ![](media/672bfb4d87b938fc586a849bff0229fe.png) | ![](media/d61a26d2f2367f0378974832f679efe1.png) |
|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Power via USB cable                             | Power via external power (3V)                   |

**Step 5**：other programming languages

This chapter has described how to use the Micro: bit main board V2.

But except for the MakeCode graphical programming introduced you can also write
Micro: bit programs in other languages. Go to the link:
<https://microbit.org/code/> to know about other programming languages , or view
the link: <https://microbit.org/projects/>, to find something you want to have a
go.

**4.2 Makecode：**

Browse <https://makecode.microbit.org/> and enter MakeCode online editor or open
the APP MakeCode for micro:bit of Windows 10.

![](media/306e32b77a5dae6927b5dd0f6cf6f4f4.png)

Click“New Project”, and input“heartbeat”，then enter MakeCode editor, as shown
below:

![](media/c5d52e632549cae8e23944f8febe5a03.png)

There are blocks“on start”and“forever”in the code editing area.

When the power is plugged or reset,“on start”means that the code in the block
only executes once, while“forever”implies that the code runs cyclically.

**4.3.Quick Download **

As mentioned before, if your computer is Windows 10 and you have downloaded the
APP MakeCode for micro:bit to write programs, the program written can be quickly
downloaded to the Micro: Bit main board V2 by selecting ‘Download’.

While it is a little trickier if you are using a browser to enter makecode.
However, if you use Google Chrome, suitable for Linux，macOS and Windows 10, the
process can be quicker too.

We use the webUSB function of Chrome to allow the internet page to access the
hardware device connected USB.

You could refer to the following steps to connect and pair devices.

**Device pairing:**

### **Project 6: Geomagnetic Sensor**

![](media/24c31bb0174e2ac672203e5c36c6875e.png)

** Project Introduction:**

This project aims to explain the use of the Micro: bit geomagnetic sensor, which
can not only detect the strength of the geomagnetic field, but also be used as a
compass to find bearings. It is also an important part of the Attitude and
Heading Reference System (AHRS). Micro: Bit main board V2 uses LSM303AGR
geomagnetic sensor, and the dynamic range of magnetic field is ±50 gauss. In the
board, the magnetometer module is used in both magnetic detection and compass.
In this experiment, the compass will be introduced first, and then the original
data of the magnetometer will be checked.The main component of a common compass
is a magnetic needle, which can be rotated by the geomagnetic field and point
toward the geomagnetic North Pole (which is near the geographic South Pole) to
determine direction.

** Components Needed:**

-   Micro:bit main board V2 \*1

-   USB cable\*1

 **Connection Diagram:**

Attach the Micro:bit main board V2 to your computer via the USB cable.

![](media/18c70cf16dcf8c9694a1af8b12530cf9.png)

  **Test Code 1:**

![](media/cea30308f8efccb99989a19b10294d75.png)

  **Test Results:**

After uploading test code to micro:bit main board V2 and powering the board via
the USB cable, and pressing the button A, the board asks us to calibrate compass
and the LED dot matrix shows “TILT TO FILL SCREEN”. Then enter the calibration
page. Rotate the board until all 25 red LEDs are on as shown below:

![](media/acf3b8c0dee027d9e555fc708831f874.jpeg)

After that, a smile pattern ![](media/55ad39536dff7bdf66379a1da7a4c137.png)
appears, which implies the calibration is done. When the calibration process is
completed, pressing the button A will make the magnetometer reading display
directly on the screen. And the direction north, east, south and west correspond
to 0°, 90°, 180° and 270°.

  **Test Code 2:**

![](media/d2b4d171fc7ddc1a26dcafa6e9896292.png)

This module can keep reading data to determine direction, so does point to the
current magnetic North Pole by arrow.

![](media/d1a4e9f62bdf690ba809ae35c347b233.png)

As shown in the figure, if the reading is between 292.5 and 337.5, the LED dot
matrix displays an arrow pointing to the top right. Since 0.5 cannot be inputted
in the code,the values added in the code are 293 and 338.Then add other logical
criteria to form a compete test code as shown below:

![](media/d2b4d171fc7ddc1a26dcafa6e9896292.png)

### **Project 25: Follow Black Line**

  **Project Introduction:**

When doing DIY experiments, you perhaps see such a smart car that can follow a
black line and not beyond the black area. How can achieve this? Yeah, make use
of line tracking sensors. In this project, we will use a tracking sensor
combined with micro:bit to detect an object or a black line. You can get the
result shown on the LED display of micro:bit.

The tracking sensor is actually an infrared sensor, which can detect a black
line. The component used in the sensor is TCRT5000 infrared tube.

Its working principle is to use the different reflectivity of infrared light to
the color, then convert the strength of the reflected signal into a current
signal.

When sensor detects a black line, the infrared rays are not emitted or the
intensity of emitted ray back are not sufficiently strong, so that the sensor’s
signal terminal outputs a High level. Otherwise, output a Low level.

  **Components Needed:**

-   Micro:bit main board\*1

-   Keyestudio Micro bit Sensor V2 Shield\*1

-   USB Cable\*1

  **Test Results**

Done wiring and powered up, send the code to micro:bit. When sensor detects no
object or detects a black line, the infrared rays are not emitted or the
intensity of emitted ray back are not sufficiently strong, so that the sensor’s
signal terminal will output a High level, LED on the

micro:bit will show the number 1. Or else show the number.

Note: on the module, you can rotate the potentiometer to make the LED between on
and off state. The sensitivity is the best.

### **Project 26: Obstacle Avoidance**

** Project Introduction:**

When doing DIY experiments, you perhaps see such a smart car that can
automatically avoid an obstacle ahead. How can achieve this? Yeah, make use of
infrared obstacle avoidance sensors. In this project, we will use a obstacle
sensor combined with micro:bit to detect an object ahead and automatically avoid
it. You can get the result shown on the LED display of micro:bit.

** Components Needed:**

-   Micro:bit main board\*1

-   Keyestudio Micro:bit Sensor V2 Shield\*1

-   USB Cable\*1

** Test Results**

Wire up the components, upload code and plug in power. When sensor detects an
object ahead, its signal terminal will output a Low level, and LED matrix on the
micro:bit will show the number 0. Or else show the number 1.

**Note:** for obstacle sensor, you can rotate the two potentiometers on the
sensor to adjust its sensitivity. Rotate the potentiometer near the infrared
transmitter tube clockwise to the end, and then adjust the potentiometer near
the infrared receiver. Sled light is turned off and keeps the critical point to
be lit. The sensing distance is the longest.

The effective distance of the sensor is within 2-40 cm.

### **Project 27: Someone Comes**

** Project Introduction:**

You may see such a lens in a film or television. When someone wants to attack a
target, but not close to the target, they were directly found and the alarm
sounded. When some special forces go to the target, they will be covered with
moist mud, so that they will not be discovered by the other party. Why ?

Originally, the human body will emit a certain wavelength of infrared rays of
about 10um. The relevant sensors are installed near the targets that are being
attacked to sense the infrared rays emitted by the human body and then alarm.
After the mud is applied, the sensors can not sense the infrared rays emitted by
the human body.

In this project, you will learn how to use a PIR motion sensor and micro:bit to
detect whether there is someone move nearby. Finally show the different images
on 25 LED matrix of micro:bit.

Right, install a flame sensor and a speaker in those places that easily break
out a fire. When the flame sensor detects a fire, the speaker will alarm people
quickly to put out the fire.

In this project, you will learn how to use a flame sensor and an active buzzer
module to simulate the fire alarm system.

This flame sensor can be used to detect fire or other light sources with
wavelength stands at 760nm \~ 1100nm. Its detection angle is about 60°. You can
rotate the potentiometer on the sensor to control its sensitivity. Adjust the
potentiometer to make the LED at the critical point between on and off state.
The sensitivity is the best.

avoidance. In the DIY process, we need a servo to control the ultrasonic module
to rotate left and right, and then to detect the distance between car and
obstacles, so as to control the car to avoid obstacles.

If use other microcontrollers to control the rotation of servo, we need to set a
pulse of a certain frequency and a certain width in order to control the servo
angle.

But if use the micro bit main board to control the servo angle, we only need to
set the control angle in the development environment. The corresponding pulse
will be automatically set in the development environment to control the servo
rotation.

In this project, you will learn how to control the micro servo rotate back and
forth between 0°and 90°.

**Components Needed:**

-   Micro:bit main board\*1

-   Keyestudio Micro bit Sensor V2 Shield\*1

-   USB Cable\*1

-   keyestudio Micro Servo\*1

should see the servo turn back and forth between 0° and 90°.

### **Project 48: Add An LCD**

**Project Introduction:**

In life, we can use the display and other sensors to do a variety of
experiments. You can DIY a variety of small items. For example, use a
temperature module and display to make a temperature tester, or use an
ultrasound module and display to make a distance tester.

In the following, we will use keyestudio 1602 I2C module as the display, connect
it to I2C pin headers of micro:bit shield. You will learn how to control the
1602 LCD show the character“keyestudio”and number.

**Components Needed:**

-   Micro:bit main board\*1

-   Keyestudio Micro bit Sensor V2 Shield\*1

-   USB Cable\*1

-   keyestudio 1602 I2C Module\*1

-   DuPont jumper wires

**Test Results**

Note: You can adjust the potentiometer at the back to make the displayed
characters brighter if the screen doesn't show characters.

Wire up the components, upload code and plug in power, then 1602LCD will
show“keyestudio”on the first line, and numbers on the second line.

### **Project 49: Analog Temperature**

** Project Introduction:**

In this project, we are going to detect another important index in the
environment, that is, temperature. You will learn how to use an analog
temperature sensor and micro:bit to display the analog value of current
temperature on the micro:bit LED matrix or on the CoolTerm monitor.

This analog temperature module is based on a thermistor whose resistance varies
with temperature change.

It can detect surrounding temperature changes in real time.

Through the circuit connection, convert the resistance changes into voltage
changes, then input the voltage changes into Analog Input of micro:bit via
signal end. Actually the analog value of micro:bit can be calculated into
temperature value via programming.

This sensor is convenient and effective, widely applied to home alarm system,
gardening, and other devices.

** Components Needed:**

-   Micro:bit main board\*1

-   Keyestudio Micro bit Sensor V2 Shield\*1

-   USB Cable\*1

-   keyestudio Analog Temperature Sensor\*1

-   DuPont jumper wires

  **Connection Diagram**
